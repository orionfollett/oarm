Orion's Subset of ARM Assembly Interpreter

Goal:
- continue practicing programming with manual memory management
- learn how to write interpreters
- learn more about assembly and how computers work
- develop mastery in a low level language

Why C?
- timeless, lots of legacy code in C
- understanding C helps understand most every other language, as well as large codebases important to me like postgres and the linux kernel
- forces me to do everything from scratch, which is a good thing since this is all educational anyways

Project:

Implement a REPL and file reading interpreter that supports a small subset of ARM assembly.

ARM supported:

- register labels
- mov
- ldr, str
- add, sub
- lsl, lsr
- cmp
- blt, bgt, ble, bge


Next project...
A compiler that generates my OARM asm from a simpler high level language?
