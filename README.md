Orion's Subset of ARM Interpreter

Goal:
- continue practicing programming with manual memory management
- learn how to write interpreters
- learn more about assembly and how computers work
- develop mastery in a low level language

- understanding C helps understand most every other language
- forces me to do everything from scratch, which is a good thing since this is all educational anyways

Project:

Implement a REPL and file reading interpreter that supports a small subset of ARM assembly.

ARM supported:
